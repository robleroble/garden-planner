# Garden Planner Journal

**7-4-2020**  
- I spent what seemed like forever figuring out how to create a repo and get everything all connected on my laptop (*note to self: use github more often so I know what I'm doing*)
- create-react-app'd myself an application. I'm planning on trying to use React for this project at the moment. We'll see how it will change in the future.

#### Key Elements Needed:
1. Form(s) to choose which plant you want, spacing, row length, etc.
2. Growing zone components that can be dragged and dropped
3. Default plant spacings for certain plants
4. Maybe I'll make my own pixel art for the graphics

#### Uncertainties:
1. How I will store the position and arrangement of the plants in the garden

#### Goals for tonight:
- Make a navbar/homepage idea (I'm thinking duolingo-theme colors, maybe lighter on the blue)
- Push to github, ya fool

#### Accomplished:
- got stuck on styling, but have an ugly home page
- got it to github!

#### Accomplished:

**I am going to scrap my current garden builder and go with a grid-pattern. I need to figure out how to make a grid without a nasty component*

**7-8-2020**

#### Goals for today:
- create garden builder that is a grid system
- create buttons that extend the garden grids one tile to the bottom or one tile to the right

#### Accomplished:
- made my grid system (should RM borders and make them inlaid to the div so they are 50px divs instead of 52px)
- added state and buttons that let you add rows and columns to garden
- Made a little shovel cursor when hovering over the grid

**7-9-2020**

#### Goals for today:
- add dimensions thingy for the grid
- fix grid borders (and fix other styling once changed... ugh)
- figure out how to store a crop in state in the grid
- play with react-selectable

#### Accomplished:
- added dimensions to grid
- set up IDs and keys corresponding to grid coordinates
- changed grid borders to be inlaid

**Not sure how I want to proceed with being able to select grid points. I'm struggling with figuring that out with react-selectable*

#### Goals for today:

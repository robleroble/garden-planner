# Garden Planner Journal

**7-4-2020**  
- I spent what seemed like forever figuring out how to create a repo and get everything all connected on my laptop (*note to self: use github more often so I know what I'm doing*)
- create-react-app'd myself an application. I'm planning on trying to use React for this project at the moment. We'll see how it will change in the future.

#### Key Elements Needed:
1. Form(s) to choose which plant you want, spacing, row length, etc.
2. Growing zone components that can be dragged and dropped
3. Default plant spacings for certain plants
4. Maybe I'll make my own pixel art for the graphics

#### Uncertainties:
1. How I will store the position and arrangement of the plants in the garden

#### Goals for tonight:
- Make a navbar/homepage idea (I'm thinking duolingo-theme colors, maybe lighter on the blue)
- Push to github, ya fool

#### Accomplished:
- got stuck on styling, but have an ugly home page
- got it to github!
